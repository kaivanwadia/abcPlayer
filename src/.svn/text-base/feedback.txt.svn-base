==============================================
= Implementation:                           45 / 50
==============================================

Functionality (25 unit tests 40 points): 37 

Invalid chord not detected. Two voice piece failed, threw token mismatch error 23/25 test cases pass. Overall well done.

Coding style (10): 8

 Use better names than Type and Token. These are very generic. Var names like isSR are very hard to reason about. Especially with 
no comments describing it.

==============================================
= Testing:                               15 / 15
==============================================
Extensive. Good job

==============================================
Be cautious of meeting with less than a full group in groups of three. It's too easy for the two to leave the third person out. Remember that the 
there is more than just code when evaluating work done. A large portion of the work for this project(and indeed most software engineering) is the design.
More importantly, any programmer can code something given a design and some time. Creating and evaluating a design is a more unique and valuable skill.

Lateness penalty (-10 per day): 0
